# Non-coding-Somatic-Mutations-in-OvCa

This repository contains custom code generated to analyze the ovarian cancer epigenome (H3K27ac ChIP-seq) and transcriptome, generate enhancer/gene maps, and identify frequently mutated regulatory elements in Ovarian Cancer using non-coding somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) from PCAWG.
